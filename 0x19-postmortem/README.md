<h1>Postmortem: Web Stack Outage on June 1, 2024</h1>

#### Issue Summary
**Duration of Outage:**
- Start Time: June 1, 2024, 10:00 AM (UTC)
- End Time: June 1, 2024, 12:30 PM (UTC)

**Impact:**
- The web application was completely inaccessible to all users.
- Users experienced 503 Service Unavailable errors.
- 100% of users were affected during the outage.

**Root Cause:**
- A misconfigured Nginx server update caused a failure in load balancing, leading to all traffic being directed to a single, overloaded server.

#### Timeline
- **10:00 AM (UTC):** Issue detected through a monitoring alert indicating 503 errors.
- **10:05 AM (UTC):** Initial investigation began focusing on server health and database connections.
- **10:15 AM (UTC):** Assumption made that the database was overloaded.
- **10:30 AM (UTC):** Misleading path: restarted the database server which did not resolve the issue.
- **10:45 AM (UTC):** Escalated to the DevOps team to investigate the web server configuration.
- **11:00 AM (UTC):** Discovered Nginx update had been applied at 9:55 AM.
- **11:15 AM (UTC):** Rolled back the Nginx configuration to the previous version.
- **11:30 AM (UTC):** Tested the rollback, but the issue persisted.
- **11:45 AM (UTC):** Identified a specific misconfiguration in the Nginx load balancing settings.
- **12:00 PM (UTC):** Corrected the Nginx configuration and redeployed.
- **12:15 PM (UTC):** Monitored system stability and performance.
- **12:30 PM (UTC):** Confirmed that the service was fully restored and operational.

#### Root Cause and Resolution
**Root Cause:**
The root cause was a misconfiguration in the Nginx load balancing settings after an update. Specifically, the update inadvertently removed the upstream server configurations, causing all incoming traffic to route to a single application server, which quickly became overloaded and unable to handle the traffic, resulting in 503 Service Unavailable errors.

**Resolution:**
To resolve the issue, the DevOps team:
1. Rolled back to the previous version of the Nginx configuration, which initially didn't resolve the issue due to the persistence of the misconfiguration.
2. Upon further investigation, identified the specific misconfiguration within the load balancing settings.
3. Corrected the load balancing settings in the Nginx configuration.
4. Deployed the corrected configuration and restarted the Nginx service.
5. Conducted thorough testing to ensure the issue was fully resolved and monitored system performance to confirm stability.

#### Corrective and Preventative Measures
**Improvements and Fixes:**
- Improve the deployment process to include a more comprehensive configuration validation step.
- Enhance monitoring to detect load balancing issues more quickly.
- Provide additional training for team members on the impacts of configuration changes.

**Tasks:**
1. **Patch Nginx Server:**
   - Ensure that the Nginx server configurations are thoroughly validated before deployment.
2. **Add Monitoring on Server Memory and Load:**
   - Implement additional monitoring to detect when a server is becoming overloaded.
3. **Automate Configuration Backups:**
   - Create automated backups of configuration files before applying updates.
4. **Update Deployment Documentation:**
   - Document the proper procedure for updating Nginx configurations and include rollback procedures.
5. **Conduct a Postmortem Review Meeting:**
   - Review the incident with the entire team to discuss what went wrong and how to avoid similar issues in the future.
6. **Implement a Staging Environment:**
   - Use a staging environment to test configuration changes before applying them to production.
